'''
A bank wants to design a system to manage different types of accounts.
Scenario:
Create a base class Account with attributes account_number and balance
Create subclasses SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount
Requirements:
Implement deposit() and withdraw() in the base class
Override withdraw() in SavingsAccount to enforce minimum balance
Override withdraw() in CurrentAccount to allow overdraft up to a limit
Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using a common interface
